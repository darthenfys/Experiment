### The night started pretty cloudy. Nothing unusual about it, this time of the year, a little cold and a little weird. The weather predicted clear skies, but when did they ever get anything right? We clocked in pretty much on time, accounting for the fact that we may end up getting lost on these snowy roads. It started like any other shift, with a little debriefing on the system specifications and how to operate the machinery. We had a long night waiting for us, but that didn’t deter us because we were excited to be budding astronomers. By hour 4, we got exhausted by the dull tasks and looked for other things to stay awake. Throw coffee, and energy drinks in the mix and we had a pretty solid two hours of fun. But we still had to kill 6 more hours. We could have explored the nearby forest with torches and our pretty useless hand device now that it didn’t have any network. We were truly cut off from the world, although we had a WLAN connection. But we live our lives in these small rectangular spaces, you know? Imagine living in 2022 with no smartphone in any first-world country. Willingly living without a smartphone, may I add. The thought seemed bizarre but so dreamy. Nothing to distract us from our hunting and exploring. And the winter forest looked daunting and taunting. The thing about northern winter is that no one can say anything to prepare you for just how cold it is. You read negative temperatures and chilly winds and your body, just young and tanned from the glow of summer, forgets all about any sense of it. No muscle memory kicks in to help you adjust to it. The chills in your bones, the constant headaches but those are nothing, nothing compared to the lack of sun. You come from a place so lit by the Sun that living in a world without it is a long cry from reality. You don’t anticipate it, the disjoint feeling of time just passing you by but in reality, it's just frozen.

###**Fear. It is a mind-killer. Conquer it and you conquer the world. A child's fears are easy to comprehend, afraid of the big monster under the bed or a fictitious person who would be punished at the sight of unfinished chores. Even as you grow older, you don't let go of these fears but add on to them. But one never stops to realise just how much of one's actions are coloured by fear. The more you look into it, the more you realise that you are surrounded by fear. People who live their lives above it must be the truly liberated ones. So much fear bleeds into conversations and thematically it is always about otherness. Perhaps we crave so much to be accepted and assimilated into our groups.**
##**You were born just shy of summer, with sun-kissed hair and sea-breeze eyes. You possessed the beauty of old. How could I have guarded my heart against that? It was yours the moment you walked in.**

##** I will peel the moon and feed you its shine.**

##**Under the pale light of the moon, surrounded by thick dense fog, 
he stares down.
He isn't afraid of the lack of visibility, 
in fact, it's a much-needed boon 
for he can use it as a cloak to hide his ulterior motives
On the coldest night of the year.
To others, he may appear as an illusion,
a figment of our imagination 
or perhaps a trick of the dim light 
He doesn't care about what names you might have 
to explain away the eerie feeling you get when you stare for too long.
He stands there, waiting, bidding his time,
for the brave yet poor soul who may approach him
in hopes of a deal or a wager with the monster man.
A perfect candidate for a mighty meal**.

##**I'm sorry, I wish you were born earlier
I hoped the world was kinder
I hoped the pain you'd carry would be human
I wish we didn't screw up on this 
Life doesn't carry only happiness but also pain and regrets. Out of all the things, I hoped to give you dreams.
About a hopeful place, even a mundane place. 
To think that even a life of mediocrity would be a luxury for you pains me.**

##**I wish I could tell you how I felt
even if you'd eventually forget
lost in chaos 
a silent echo of my dreams
I know you'd never feel the same
I'd never dare to entertain that thought 
Not even for the second of joy it brings me.
I'd happily give you my smiles, my care, my concern
And you'll never know it.
Love, thought I may have for you
but naivè, I'm not.
I would choose a thousand fantasies, a thousand scenarios over the reality of you.
Because it's better this way,
it's saner this way,
the world feels normal this way.
Oh, how I want to make you mine
but your very presence would drive me away.
It's a little game, is it not?
For me and perhaps for you too.
You seem brighter than the moon,
a creature of nox,
and I? no more than a mere entity.
It could be different, sure.
I could unsettle you with my truth,
burden you with my pain,
drag you down with my sin,
But you poor thing, you did nothing to deserve that.
Maybe you from my dreams would be much sweeter, much safer, much more predictable and much more in love with me.
And then perhaps I could sing to you
my song of darkness,
knowing that you'd hum along.**

##**To be romantic is to be in love with the  possibilities of life. It isn't necessarily viewing the world with rosy coloured glasses but rather seeing it for what it is and accepting its complexity. I may not know what you are but I'm excited at the possibility of what you'll be. It's about writing a story when there isn't one just because you can.**

##**It's cruel that I should keep wanting you 
but then again isn't it the same for you?
Do I not affect you in the same manner?
Do I not burn your heart, nor make your blood boil?
Do I not drive you crazy because you can never have me, no matter how much you might desire me?
There is much fun in that knowledge,
that I can hurt you just as much,
and you'd never back off.
It tantalizes me in ways I didn't think possible, feeds that insidious thing in me with power,
that immense power over you.
I want to make you build empires in my name,
with monuments that reach the stars, signifying your devotion to me.
I want to possess you,
 And make you sing praises of my glory.
Only through these vicious actions,
can my heart be quenched and silenced.**

##**You are the sun to my moon
I shine as a reflection of you
I embody beauty with you behind me,
a fraud, an artist's muse
For it all comes from you
How naive is the world,
that your brilliance carries no praise
It is from you that I blaze
Someday it will wake up and gaze
with the softness and kindness it owes
To the giver of beauty and grace.**

##**When all the world has gone to sleep
With moss growing over signs of civilization
Who'd hum along to the echoes 
of an ethereal song 
A tune plucked out of a dream?
Entertaining an audience of air,
bouncing its melodies on empty pathways.
Would they praise its glory?
or take comfort in its rhythm? 
Maybe life lives on beyond our grasp, the life to value such a song
maybe it can bloom only in our absence when we are long gone
when our echoes are forgotten to time.**
